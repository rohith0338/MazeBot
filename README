Compile Instructions: 
This project was compiled using the GNU g++ compiler and requires map.txt to be in the same folder as MazeSolver.cpp

Information:
This project uses Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS) and A * Search (AS) search methods in order to solve nxn mazes. 
The code begins by reading in map.txt and assigning its values to an equivalent size 2D array. It then goes through BFS, DFS and AS in 
order to find exits marked E1, E2 and navigate from bottom left corner to the top right corner of the maze.
